      <p>Welcome! Thanks for coming 🙏⭐</p>
      <p>
        We likely don't have enough chairs 🪑🪑🪑 in the space today to fit everyone. If that's the
        case please be kind and leave the available chairs to whoever needs them most. Feel free to
        sit in the floor, stand and move around the room to keep the blood in your legs flowing!
      </p>
      <p>
        This event is for anyone who is curious about creative coding - whether you are a beginner
        or a seasoned developer.

        Last time we talk about <b>chapter 0</b> which was about Randomness. Today we're talking about
        <a class='ccb-link' href='https://natureofcode.com/vectors/' target='_blank'>chapter 1</a>,
        which teaches how to work with <b>vectors</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today we will use Etherpad during the meetup to collect ideas, notes, feedback and anything
        that you want to communicate publicly by text. The link for today's shared environment is <a
          class='ccb-link'

        >. The document will vanish 60 days after the meetup.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also raise your hand 🙋 and share anything at any point during the meeting. Don't be
        shy! (or be shy! whatever you want!)

        What were the main takeaways for you from reading this chapter? What things did you struggle
        with? What things did you learn?
      </p>
      <p>Here is a 10min video about vectors that I think is worth sharing:</p>

      <p>
        "Think about an arrow inside a coordinate system, with its tail sitting at the origin"
        (3Blue1Brown)
      </p>
      <p>
        "Each vector represents a certain <b>movement</b>, a step with a certain <b
          >distance (magnitude)</b
        > and direction in space."
      </p>
      <p><b>Vector Addition</b></p>
      <p>
        Can be visualized as simply moving through each of the vectors, after placing the tail of
        the latter sitting on the tip of the former.
      </p>
      <p><b>Scalar multiplication</b></p>
      <p>
        Can be visualized as stretching (*2) or compressing (*0.5) a vector. Multiplying by a
        negative number (*-1.8) can be visualized as flipping the vector first, and then scaling it
        in the new direction by that number
      </p>
      <p>
        Multiplying a vector by a scalar means multiplying each of its component by that scalar.
        (e.g. [3, 4] * 2 = [6, 8])
