      <p>Welcome! Thanks for coming üôè‚≠ê</p>
      <p>
        We likely don't have enough chairs ü™ëü™ëü™ë in the space today to fit everyone. If that's the
        case please be kind and leave the available chairs to whoever needs them most. Feel free to
        sit in the floor, stand and move around the room to keep the blood in your legs flowing!
      </p>
      <p>
        This event is for anyone who is curious about creative coding - whether you are a beginner
        or a seasoned developer.

        Last time we talk about <b>chapter 0</b> which was about Randomness. Today we're talking about
        <a class='ccb-link' href='https://natureofcode.com/vectors/' target='_blank'>chapter 1</a>,
        which teaches how to work with <b>vectors</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today we will use Etherpad during the meetup to collect ideas, notes, feedback and anything
        that you want to communicate publicly by text. The link for today's shared environment is <a
          class='ccb-link'

        >. The document will vanish 60 days after the meetup.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also raise your hand üôã and share anything at any point during the meeting. Don't be
        shy! (or be shy! whatever you want!)

        What were the main takeaways for you from reading this chapter? What things did you struggle
        with? What things did you learn?

      <p>Here is a 10min video about vectors that I think is worth sharing:</p>
      <iframe
        class='w-full h-[315px]'
        src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fNk_zzaMoSs?si=W4yarF6-G0goFycD'

      <p>
        "Think about an arrow inside a coordinate system, with its tail sitting at the origin"
        (3Blue1Brown)
      </p>
      <p>
        "Each vector represents a certain <b>movement</b>, a step with a certain <b
          >distance (magnitude)</b
        > and direction in space."
      </p>
      <p><b>Vector Addition</b></p>
      <p>
        Can be visualized as simply moving through each of the vectors, after placing the tail of
        the latter sitting on the tip of the former.
      </p>
      <p><b>Scalar multiplication</b></p>
      <p>
        Can be visualized as stretching (*2) or compressing (*0.5) a vector. Multiplying by a
        negative number (*-1.8) can be visualized as flipping the vector first, and then scaling it
        in the new direction by that number
      </p>
      <p>
        Multiplying a vector by a scalar means multiplying each of its component by that scalar.
        (e.g. [3, 4] * 2 = [6, 8])

        Our website is open-source, besides uploading your sketches, you can also contribute to it
        in <a
          class='ccb-link'

          target='_blank'>github</a

      </p>
      <p>Pull requests on Github are not everything. There are many ways you can collaborate!</p>
      <p>Here are some ideas:</p>
      <ul class='space-y-6'>
        <li>
          <b>MONTHLY POSTER:</b> Every month we do a custom poster for our <a
            class='ccb-link'
            href='https://lu.ma/creativecodingbookclub'
            target='_blank'>Luma</a
          > event. If you're interested in making the poster some month send us a mail before the end
          of the previous month and we'll have a think about how to facilitate this!
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SITE FONTS:</b> If you are a designer and you like typography, it would be very cool to
          have custom fonts for the headings (<e>h1</e>, <e>h2</e>, <e>h3</e>). At the moment these
          fonts are placeholder. Our main requirement would be that the fonts are readable and
          ideally monospace.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> HOMEPAGE LOGO: </b> The logo in our homepage is also placeholder! It would be cool to randomize
          this to include logos made by different people. It should read 'creative coding bookclub' and
          use our current main <b>brand color</b>. Lets also use <b>svg</b> as the export format so we
          can dynamically change the brand color color in the future, or even randomize it!
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> HOMEPAGE SKETCH: </b>. We have a placeholder sketch as the background of the homepage.
          Get in touch if you like the idea of making more sketches for the homepage. Main
          constraints here are that the sketch draws something from left to right, spanning the
          whole width of the screen, and that it is monocrome (to keep the brand color in the logo
          above standing out). Also this sketch should not be animated (only P5's <e>`setup()`</e> function
          should be used)
        </li>
      </ul>

        Remember we're in Bluesky and Mastodon (Mickey also in Instagram). Feel free to reach to us
        and keep in touch in there!
