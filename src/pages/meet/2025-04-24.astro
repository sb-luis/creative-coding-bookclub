        Last time we talked about <b>chapter 1</b> - vectors. Today we're talking about
        <a class='ccb-link' href='https://natureofcode.com/vectors/' target='_blank'>chapter 2</a>,
        which teaches how to work with <b>forces</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can interrupt us anytime, or just raise your hand üôã and share anything at any point
        during the meeting. Don't be shy! (or be shy! whatever you want!)

        What were the main takeaways for you from reading this chapter? What things did you struggle
        with? What things did you learn?
      </p>
      <p>Here is a 10min video about vectors that I think is worth sharing:</p>

      <p><b>What is a force?</b></p>
      <p>A force is a vector that causes an object with mass to accelerate</p>
      <p><b>Newton's laws of motion</b></p>
      <ol class='pl-8 list-decimal space-y-2'>
        <li>An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion</li>
        <li>Force equals mass times acceleration.</li>
        <li>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction</li>
      </ol>

        Our website is open-source, besides uploading your sketches, you can also contribute to it
        in <a
          class='ccb-link'
          href='https://github.com/sb-luis/creative-coding-bookclub'
          target='_blank'>github</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>Pull requests on Github are not everything. There are many ways you can collaborate!</p>
      <p>Here are some ideas:</p>
      <ul class='space-y-6'>
        <li>
          <b>MONTHLY POSTER:</b> Every month we do a custom poster for our <a
            class='ccb-link'
            href='https://lu.ma/creativecodingbookclub'
            target='_blank'>Luma</a
          > event. This month's poster was a sketch from <a
            class='ccb-link'
            href='https://github.com/fabcreative'
            target='_blank'>Fabio</a
          >! If you're interested in making the poster some month get in touch!
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>SITE FONTS:</b> If you are a designer and you like typography, it would be very cool to
          have custom fonts for the headings (<e>h1</e>, <e>h2</e>, <e>h3</e>). At the moment these
          fonts are placeholder. Our main requirement would be that the fonts are readable and
          ideally monospace.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> HOMEPAGE LOGO: </b> The logo in our homepage is also placeholder! It would be cool to randomize
          this to include logos made by different people. It should read 'creative coding bookclub' and
          use our current main <b>brand color</b>. Lets also use <b>svg</b> as the export format so we
          can dynamically change the brand color color in the future, or even randomize it!
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> HOMEPAGE SKETCH: </b>. We have a placeholder sketch as the background of the homepage.
          Get in touch if you like the idea of making more sketches for the homepage. Main
          constraints here are that the sketch draws something from left to right, spanning the
          whole width of the screen, and that it is monocrome (to keep the brand color in the logo
          above standing out). Also this sketch should not be animated (only P5's <e>`setup()`</e> function
          should be used)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Remember we're in Bluesky and Mastodon (Mickey also in Instagram). Feel free to reach to us
        and keep in touch in there!

        If you have any questions about this or previous chapters, the website, or the bookclub in
        general, please ask them!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're feeling inspired. Go to the <a

          target='_blank'>P5JS WebEditor</a

        some pair-programming.

        We need to leave by 8.15pm, but some people like hanging at a nearby pub afterwards, feel
        free to join!
